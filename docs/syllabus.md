# CS 481 - Senior Design Project

Department of Computer Science - Boise State University  

## Catalog Description - CS 481

**CS 481 SENIOR DESIGN PROJECT (0-6-3)(F,S)(FF).** Capstone experience designing, implementing, and testing an assigned software artifact. Students report progress via documentation, meetings and demos. Class concludes with a presentation and demonstration of the completed product to students, faculty and project sponsors. Topics include teamwork, communication, ethics, project management, tools, design, verification and validation. PREREQ: CS 471.

## Learning Objectives

- Setup a software project from end to end using industry standard tools
- Work as a member of a team
- Solve a real world problem using the tools and skills learned in your undergraduate classes
- Learn valuable presentation skills

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this class

## ABET and Finishing Foundations (FF) assessment

CS481 - Senior Design is part of the departments assessment plan for both ABET and the Universities Foundational Studies program. CS481 serves as a capstone course applying all that has been learned during the student’s undergraduate curriculum, as well as newly acquired skills, to complete a significant real-world project.  CS481 supports [University Learning Outcomes (ULO)](https://www.boisestate.edu/academics-uf/) 2, 3 and 4 as specified by the Foundational Studies program and ABET outcomes 1,2, and 3.

## ABET outcomes

- **Outcome 1** - Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
  - Students are required to take a domain specific problem such as inventory control and map that back to a software solution.
  - The instrument used to evaluate this outcome is the [planning 2](../labs/planning-2) lab.
- **Outcome 2** - Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
  - Students are required to setup their project to industry standards. This includes setting up a build system, continuous integration, automated testing and automated versioning and deployment
  - The instrument used to evaluate this outcome is [demo-1](../labs/demo-1)
- **Outcome 5** - Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.
  - Teams must equally divide work among all members and use industry tools such as Git to make progress on an assigned software artifact.
  - The instrument used to evaluate this outcome is the commit history of the teams repo gathered at the end of the semester.

## Finishing foundation outcomes (FF)

- **ULO 2** -  Communicate effectively in speech, both as a speaker and listener.
  - Students are required to give 2 presentations over the semester to demonstrate their progress. The presentations have a strict time limit and all team members must participate.
- **ULO 3** - Engage in effective critical inquiry by defining problems, gathering and evaluating evidence, and determining the adequacy of argumentative discourse.
  - Students are required to evaluate several competing software engineering tools such as build systems and give a pro/con analysis of each.
- **ULO 4** - Think creatively about complex problems to produce, evaluate, and implement innovative possible solutions, often as one member of a team.
  - Students must identify and define the technical tasks that are necessary to accomplish several software engineering tasks over the course of the semester.

## Academic Honesty

**Academic dishonesty is grounds for immediate failure of the course.** CS481 is a team based class where students are expected to work together. Thus, for this class, academic dishonesty consists of forging false progress reports, exaggerating or falsifying the amount of time spent working on classroom deliverables, **backdating reports** to make it look like work was done in a previous week, or plagiarizing another student's work. As a student you are responsible for knowing the academic integrity policy at Boise State University.

- As a student you are responsible for knowing the [policies](http://registrar.boisestate.edu/general-information-and-policies/)
- If you need help with accessibility you can visit the [educational access center](https://eac.boisestate.edu/)
- Please review the [safety document](http://coen.boisestate.edu/cs/safetydocument)
- Please review the [student code of conduct](https://deanofstudents.boisestate.edu/student-code-of-conduct/)

## Grading

Your grade will be calculated as follows:

- 55% - Team deliverables
  - Successful completion of all the assigned Labs as detailed in the [README.md](../README.md)
- 30% - Individual effort
  - All work will be recorded as commits to your team repository. This can consist of code, documentation, planning, etc. It is the responsibility of each team member to ensure their efforts are properly recorded over the course of the semester. All team members are expected to make weekly contributions to the project. Failure to make commits to your teams’ repository will impact your final grade. **Backdating** efforts to a previous week is considered academic dishonesty
- 15% - Senior Design showcase
  - Participate in the Senior Design showcase at the end of the semester. Any team member that has a class conflict must document that conflict with the instructor in advance otherwise it is expected that all members of the team are present for the showcase.
- 2.5% - Extra credit, complete the end of semester course evaluation
