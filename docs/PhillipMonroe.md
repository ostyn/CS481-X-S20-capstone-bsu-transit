## Week 3



### 01/28/20

We met with Shane in class to confirm we plan to meet our sponsor later this week as well as review expectations.



### 01/30/20

We discussed basic structure of the project as well as establishing languages to be used. We decided that we will attempt to utilize docker to package the project all together. We also established some very broad user stories and decided on using ZenHub to track them.

#### Languages:

- Python3 with Flask

- MySQL

- Angular with Material

#### TODO:

- Read Masabi Documentation

- Ensure all languages are installed on laptop
