## Garett Skaar - Transit Notes

### 1/30/2020

We meet with Jared today and he walked us down to the City Go/Valley Regional Transit Office. We had our pictures taken for security access badges.

We then began to discuss the project at very high level. The basic idea is to allow a portal, for employers, to grant their employees some form of transportation pass using the existing Masabi API. This portal will also be used by City Go employees to administer and manage employers capable of distributing these passes. We are expecting to recieve User stories from City Go that will explain these needs in more detail.

#### Potential User Story
*As an employer I want to add passes to my employees account so that they can utilize their transit benefits.
*As a City Go admin, I want to administer city employers, so that they can distribute transit passes to their employees
