### 2/6/2020

- Met with Jared.  Katie was not available to meet this week.
- Received security badges.

#### Discussed 
- Reviewed Masabi's Recommended Flow graphic for using External Orders API.
- Logged questions to submit to Masabi and CityGo (Katie). 

#### Questions/Comments

- Using an existing UI template may be unnecessary
- We may consider a third party authentication service to manage user login
- Define: "get our stations", "get our stations back", and "get our products"
- Does it make more sense to create a separate userID for users receiving Employee issued tickets vs personal accounts??
- Payments will be handled separately.  If the Employer can access the application, they can add/delete users and issue tickets.
- How often can tickets be issued??  What is the rate limit??
- What ticket products/passes will be available (single day, 31 day)??
- Does it matter if the ticket holders are on different pass renewal schedules??
- Are Employer issued passes different from regular passes??
- What will happen to issued passes if the user is deleted/fired??
- What is a rider??
- What qualifies a rider for a purchase?
- Do we have access/link to user Id's as Masabi has them stored??
- The UI will be used by CityGo admin and Employers, but admin will have additional credentials.  
	- CityGo to have access to replicate the Employers UI flow. 
- Can the Employer create the account themselves from the app or will only admin have this access??

#### To Do
- Concept the UI and LogIn
- Become familiar with the build tools we are using.
