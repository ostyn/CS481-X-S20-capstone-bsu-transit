## Week 3

We meet with Jared today and he walked us down to the City Go/Valley Regional Transit Office. We had our pictures taken for security access badges.

We then began to discuss the project at very high level. The basic idea is to allow a portal, for employers, to grant their employees some form of transportation pass using the existing Masabi API. This portal will also be used by City Go employees to administer and manage employers capable of distributing these passes. We are expecting to recieve User stories from City Go that will explain these needs in more detail.

#### Potential User Story
* As an employer I want to add passes to my employees account so that they can utilize their transit benefits.
* As a City Go admin, I want to administer city employers, so that they can distribute transit passes to their employees

| Potential Users 	   |
| :-------------------:|
| Downtown Employers   | 
| Downtown Employees   |
| BSU Students/Faculty |
| City Go Staff 	   |

#### Tasks

* Setup our repository with zenhub
* Complete Doodle form to determine time outside of class schedule to meet
* Research the Masabi API and understand it
* Install agreed upon technology stack for personal development enviroment
  * python3(Flask)
  * MySQL
  * Angular with Angular Material
  * Docker

## Week 4

We were able to get our security badges for the VRT office. Our main City Go contact was out of town this week, so we are still waiting on more concrete User Stories for the application. We used our time in the office to talk about how we may implement certain aspects of the application, but it was difficult because we still don't know exactly what we are developing. At a very high level, we discussed Employer needs, Admin needs, and Rider needs. Again, these are all expected to change, but it did produce some good questions for us to ask both our sponser and Masabi.

Once we find out how City Go will deal transit passes to Employers, we can then discuss in detail, how to build our application and handle transactions with Masabi. In the mean time, we plan on emailing Masabi questions and studying their API, to see what flexibility we have with these transit passes. Our City Go sponser will be at the next meeting and I believe we will then be able to formulate actual User Stories and begin prototyping our application.

## Week 5

Today we met hoping that Katie would be there to answer some of our questions about what it is we are trying to achieve. She did, however, have a sales pitch that hour and couldn't make it until the end. During our meeting, we did make some good work discussing what we would do given circumstance A, B, or C. Once Katie made it in, she explained that the primary focus should be on the distribution of passes from an Employer to an Employee.

#### The System in Place

There is still some confusion about how this is currently being done. It sounds as though Employers will recieve an email with a link from City Go. This Email will then be sent to all Employees that qualify for the transit pass. The Employee will then click the link, which will take them to a City Go sign up page. The form is completed and then City Go is notified that a new user has been created. The new user is then cross checked with the list of employees that are on the valid list. If the employee is found on the list, they are then given the benefits provided and they can then use them through their ride app.That is my take away from what we discussed, but there is plenty of room for error.

#### The New System to be Built

Ideally, if an employer chooses to pay for any form of transit for their employees, they will use our application to distribute these passes to their individual employees and automatically upload their Rider app with the transit pass. Instead of emails chained down with a link and a sign up, the Employee will just open their Ride app and use the pass. It is required that we still keep the physical paper passes in play. 

We may need to create City Go accounts on the fly, or even Ride accounts on the fly as well. We have alot more to discuss, but we are getting close to a goal and some concrete user stories.

## Week 6

This weeks meeting was much different. Katie was there ready to go and explained the specific scope of the project. We are primarily focused on distributing passes to employees from an employer portal. These passes will be 31 day transit passes and will need to be updated automatically. There is nothing more that they want us to focus on for now. This makes the creation of tasks and user stories much easier.

After Katie spoke, Jared took over and began asking us what kind of tasks we would like to take on. Much of them were stubbed out skeleton methods and views. We divided the new workload and got our first assignment. I chose to build a skeleton City Go Admin view. This component is the view that City Go employees will be routed to after they successfully log in. We will write our own user stories and tasks and start Sprint 1.

## Week 7

We did a very simple stand up meeting and talked about what each one of us worked on. My task was rather trivial and I feel everyone else kind of felt the same way.  Once we finished our stand up, we discussed more possible tasks and whether or not we wanted to continue working on the same issues. I ended up choosing CRUD operations for employersm, switching from front to back. We have a Flask API that needs endpoints, so I am planning on running a local DB with our DB schema and try to create proper JSON objects from the DB, to be sent to the Angular front end. On to Sprint 2

## Week 8

We meet with Jared on a Zoom meeting this week. We decided to be part of the solution and continue our meetings online for the rest of the semeseter. The meeting went really well, we all took turns dicussing what we accomplished and what we are working on. After that, we decided on new tasks and what still needed to be finished. I personally have to continue work on the CRUD employer operations. I detoured away from that task to complete the ORM application refactor. Now that it is up and running, I can finish my task for this sprint. I would also like to note that I work for the Legislature Services Office and due to the pressure of shutting down the building and keeping people home, we have 2 months worth of work needing to be done this week. I keep working 12 hour shifts and have very little time to contribute to the project this week. I will still be able to get my task done, I just havent been as involved as I would like. Again this is just for the record and I don't think it will affect my ability to finish what is assigned to me.
