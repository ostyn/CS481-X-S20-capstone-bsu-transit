Met with sponsor. Started to plan the design around the two user stories we came up with during our first meeting. Those being:

Questions for Masabi:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;What identifies an account (Rider object in API diagram)?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we get that information for an existing account?  
Questions for Katie:
