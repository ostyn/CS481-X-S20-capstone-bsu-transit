# Planning document 1

In all the previous labs you have been preparing for this moment! You are to take everything you learned about build systems, unit/system testing, continuos integration, and deployment and meld it all together into a complete project! In the root of this repository is a folder named [code](../../code). You are to setup your project in the code directory using all the files that you have already written and researched in the previous labs. Now you can work on adding in features into your project over the next two months of class.

Each team member needs to plan out enough work for then next two weeks.

## Jane Tasks

- I will author the Model class for a Student in the system to store their Name, Id, Major, year, email, and list of classes they have taken
- I will author the Controller class that will load/store/edit students in the database.
- I will provide Unit tests for both the Model and Controller classes
- I will know that I am done by having a set of unit/system tests that exercise my new code.

## John Tasks

- I will develop the front end UI that hooks into the model/controller classes that Jane is writing
- I will write front end JavaScript to validate all user input
- I will provide the code to dynamically redisplay the information without having to query the database again.
- I will write tests using the selenium web browser automation framework

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).
