# Continuous Integration (CI) documentation

Keeping your code base healthy is an important part of the software engineering process. For this class we will leverage [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) or [appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) to test your code. Your task is to setup ci to test the **hello world** project that you created in the previous lab.

You will document **how** you setup continuous integration with your particular language and frameworks. The CI system **must** execute the example tests that you wrote in the testing lab.

TODO: Write your documentation here

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).
