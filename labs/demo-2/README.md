# Demo 2 preparation for the showcase

All teams will bring their Senior Design Poster to class. If there was an issue with printing that was/is outside of your control you must notify your instructor ASAP! This demo will act as a final sign off to participate in the Senior showcase during the final week. Any team that doesn't have a poster will not be participating in the showcase and will forfeit any points associated with the event as specified in the syllabus.

## Submission

There is nothing to submit for this lab. The deliverable is the physical poster that you had printed out. You will receive credit by showing up to class with your poster completed.
