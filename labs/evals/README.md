# Course evaluation

Complete the student [course evaluation](https://www.boisestate.edu/ir-broncocourseevals/student-course-evals/) to receive 2.5% extra credit added to the top of your grade as specified in the [syllabus](../../docs/syllabus.md)

**IMPORTANT!** This assignment is optional, if you don't want to do the end of course evals that is fine. This is 100% extra credit :)

## Submission
