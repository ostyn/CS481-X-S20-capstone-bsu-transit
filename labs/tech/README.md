# Language and Frameworks

## Technical summary

This is a summary of all the technologies that you think you will be using for this project, you have many choices so your job is to research all the possibilities and select something to use for your project. Some technologies work better than others in a domain. For example, if you are going to work on an embedded system you should probably use C/C++, if you are going to be making a web application you should probably use PHP, Python, or Nodejs.

**If you are working on a sponsored project you need to include your sponsor in these decisions.**

## Programming language

Summarize the programming language you will be using. Be specific! For example don’t just say Java, you need to say what version of Java, and any other relevant info such as Java EE, SE, etc. At this point you should know enough about your project to select the best language. You need to explain the reasons why your team made its selection.

If you are going to use a language that you have never used you need to work through some basic tutorials on how to use the language. **It is critical that you add any work you do to this folder** so you can get credit. If you work through some tutorials you should upload all the code you wrote, if you just read the documentation you need to upload a summary of what you read.

## Frameworks

Most projects will be using frameworks, don’t reinvent the wheel! Take some time to see what you can pull in to make your life easier. For example if you are building a web application is there a popular framework that you can bring use? If you are using C# you can use ASP.NET core or if you are using NodeJS you can bring in express. You should summarize everything you will be using here as well as justify to the best of your ability the technical reasons you think you need said frameworks.

## Changes in the Future

Keep in mind that you may make drastic changes as you learn more about your problem domain. The choices that you make here may be modified or updated in future labs as you get more experience, this is just a place to start!

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).
