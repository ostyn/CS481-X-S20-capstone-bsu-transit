# Language and Frameworks

## Technical summary

Our first meeting with City Go and Jared consisted mostly of what our technolagy stack could or should be. They need an application for Employers to distribute transit passes to their Employees, and administrative features for City Go employees to manage the Employers in the system. 

We all agreed that a web application would be the best solution for these features and decided upon the following technologies.

| Tech             | Purpose                    |
| -----------------|----------------------------| 
| Angular          | Frontend UI                |
| Angular Materials| Frontend Design Framework  |
| python3 (Flask)  | Backend Web Framework      |
| MySQL            | Relational Database        |
| Docker           | Virtualization             |

## Frameworks

### Angular
Angular is a very popular Frontend Javascript Framework. Developed by Google, Angular makes building enterprise quality applications simple. Angular, formerly known as Angular.js, is written in TypeScript and focuses on Component based development. Components keep the application modular and makes code reuse easy. Each Component has its UI template and Class functionality seperate and organized. The Angular CLI can build these Components and other Application objects for you, so you can just focus on the code. We chose Angular because a few of us have used it before and it is very easy to get up and running.

### python (Flask)
Flask is a lightweight web application framework. It is one of the most popular web app frameworks available today. Flask is very easy to get up and running, and it doesn't force any dependencies on the developers. We decided that we will specifically use python3 along with Flask to communicate with our Application and the Masabi API.

## Programming languages

The languages we are working in were determined by our Framework choices. The most promenent being TypeScript/JavaScript and python3. We then of course need the necessary HTML, CSS and SQL.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. Although Angular is written in TypeScript, JavaScript can be used within an Angular Applcation.

### python3

Python (Flask) will be running our backend. Python is one of the most popular backend language choices today. It is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose PL that emphasizes code readability. Due to the significant differences between python 2 and 3, we decided as a team to strictly use python3.
