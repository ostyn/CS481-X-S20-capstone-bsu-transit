# Setup

Now that you have been assigned a team you must do the following:

- Update the team member section in **this** document with each team members information.
- Decide on a method of communication during the semester. For example [slack](https://slack.com/), old school email, [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), etc.
- Dedicate 1 member of your team to be in charge of communicating with your sponsor.

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).
