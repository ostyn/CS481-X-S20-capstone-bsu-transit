# Testing documentation

Testing your code is important! There are hundreds of options that are largely dependent on the language and frameworks that you are using. You will need to research all the options available to you and select an appropriate testing framework.

You will document **how** you setup your tests and will write a small set of tests to exercise your simple **hello world** program that you wrote in the previous lab.

Here is an example using cmake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make check
```

TODO: Write your documentation here

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).
