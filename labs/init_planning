##### Played the “name game”.

#### Options for the Login build, best to use third-party service:
- Google instant sign-in  https://developers.google.com/identity
- Auth0  https://auth0.com/
- Amazon https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/login-with-amazon

##### Dez has created NG new (angular) in shared repo.

>At the end of our meeting we determined that our initial focus for this application will be to allow employers to push a bundle of passes to all of their employees that are participating under their "wallet".
_(Most of what we had discussed/planned was prior to this understanding and thus became less relevant)_ 


#### What we discussed:

##### Current sign up process for new users:
- CityGo sends an email that contains a link to the employer that will allow them to sign-up on the CityGo website.
- The employer distributes the email to their employees
- Employees follow the link and sign-up using their email (work email preferred but not always what they use)


Currently CityGo issues paper tickets.
Issuing paper tickets will be required in some cases, but the aim is to minimize
the paper ticket process and rather push tickets to the JustRide app.

Much of the current system involves manual data entry in excel.

It is not an issue signing up mid-month.
If an employee leaves the employer, the pass will just expire and not be reissued.


#### To Do:
##### Type up and email a list of questions for Katie, and same for Masabi. <br/>
_What kinds of tickets will be provided?_ <br/>
_What is a rider?_ <br/>
_What qualifies a rider for a purchase?  ..._
