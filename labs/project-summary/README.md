# Transit (CityGO)

## Executive summary

The goal of this project is to create a web application for employers so they can provide CityGo passes to their employees. Currently, the CityGo app only allows individual accounts and would be difficult for employers to provide passes as a benefit. This application will streamline the process of purchasing multiple passes for multiple accounts and allow automatic, scheduled payments from the employer. 

## Detailed summary

This project will be a web app using Python 3 (Flask), MySQL, and Angular. The current CityGo app utilizes the Masabi Justride API for processing the orders, so we will incorporate that into our app. The design for this project will be expanded on 2/6 when we have a chance to gather the full requirements from both sponsors.

## Sponsored projects

We will meet with our sponsor every week on Thursday at 1:30pm down in the Valleyride office. We do not have access to the original CityGo app source code, so we have a fair amount of freedom designing this project. Our communication will be over GroupMe in a group text, to ensure everyone is on the same page. Because of the variety in everyone's schedule, individual/small group work will be done throughout the week and reviewed at the weekly meetings to ensure everyone is productive. 

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort!
