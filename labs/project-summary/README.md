# Your Project Name

## Executive summary

You need to summarize your project in layman terms. This should be targeted to an executive who is going to be writing you a check to do your project but has no technical background. If you are working on a sponsored project you should use the project abstract as a guideline. I expect the team to paraphrase the abstract not just cut and paste the existing description.

## Detailed summary

You need to describe the project in enough detail so you can understand what the technical constraints are. For example, is this a mobile project, web based project, embedded project, etc? Understanding the technical constraints will impact the rest of your semester, so take your time to understand your project to the best of your ability.

You will use this document to help choose the programming language and any frameworks that you will need. For some teams this will be very straight forward. For example if you are going to do a Linux kernel driver you have to use C. If you are working on a sponsored project you may be leveraging existing code and have no choice but to use what the project has already specified.

## Sponsored projects

If you are working on a sponsored project you **must** contact your sponsor and setup a time to meet with them during this week. In your meeting you will review the project and detail the semesters schedule. You will be interacting with the sponsor primarily on the planning/demo sections during the semester.

Here is a list of possible questions that you should ask your sponsor.

- Is there any code, documents, or data that our team should have?
- Do you have any preference regarding languages or frameworks?
- Can we setup a regular meeting time with you this semester?
- What is the best way to get in touch with you?
- How should we address you in our communications (Sir, Mr./Mrs., First name, Dr., etc.)
- Do you have any questions for us?
- **Important** Make sure your sponsor has access to this repository.

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).
