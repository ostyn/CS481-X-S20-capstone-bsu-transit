# Demo 1

You will present your project to the class. Due to teams using different technologies presentations will be team dependent. For example a team working on a Web based application can show off their website, a team working on a backend application can talk about the problems that they are solving. We want to allow all teams to present in 1 day, thus all presentations will be a **maximum** of 5 minutes. You will be cut off at the 5 minute mark so please practice your presentation before hand.

## Base requirements

At a minimum your demo **MUST** contain the following:

- Show your project building from the command line
- Show your project executing your tests
- Show the results of a recent CI run
- Show your project automatically build a deployment package
- Show progress from your first sprint. What you said you were going to do in your [planning-1](../planning-1) document.

[Here](../../docs/demo-slide-deck.pptx) is an example presentation that you can build on.

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).
