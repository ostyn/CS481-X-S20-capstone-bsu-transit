# Senior design pamphlet info

You must update this document with the requested documentation below. This information will be put into an information pamphlet to hand to people who attend the Senior Showcase at the end of the semester! Do a good job to sell your project because there are lots of companies who attend the Senior Design poster session looking for potential employees!

## Submission

All files for this lab should be added to **this** directory. Remember that [30% of your grade](../../docs/syllabus.md#grading) is dependent on individual effort! So you **MUST** document what you worked on for this lab. If you spent the entire lab doing research then you must upload a summary of your research. Any work that is not documented by some sort of artifact (source code, documentation, etc.) will not be counted towards your final grade.

This lab is due on the date specified in the root level [README.md](../../README.md).

**NOTE:** If this lab is not completed ON TIME the team will not be participating in the Senior Showcase and will forfeit those points as defined in the syllabus.
